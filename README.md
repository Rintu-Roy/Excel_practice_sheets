- Conditional formatting can be used to highlight cells or ranges containing large values by applying formatting styles such as bold text, a specific fill color, or a prominent font.
- Similarly, conditional formatting allows for the highlighting of cells or ranges with small values, helping to identify data points that are below a certain threshold or are comparatively insignificant.
- By using conditional formatting rules for highlighting repeated values, you can easily identify duplicate or recurring data entries within your Excel sheet, making it convenient for data deduplication or data quality checks.
- Excel's conditional formatting options offer various customizable features, such as color scales, data bars, and icon sets, allowing you to visually represent the magnitude or frequency of values within your data.
